# Airbnb Property Unlisting Prediction

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter. This project leverages real Airbnb property descriptions, host descriptions, and comments from previous guests.

Using the NLP techniques learned during the Text Mining course, the objective is to implement an NLP classification model that predicts if a property will be unlisted (1) or remain listed (0). The project is developed using Python and libraries such as NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Keras, or PyTorch. Multiple solutions are possible, and collaboration between groups on code is not allowed.

## Datasets

The corpora for the project is divided into the following sets:

- **Train (train.xlsx)**: Contains 6,248 lines of Airbnb and host descriptions (`description` and `host_about` columns), and the property listing status (`unlisted` column). A property is considered unlisted (1) if it was removed from the quarterly Airbnb list, and listed (0) if it remains on that list.

- **Train Reviews (train_reviews.xlsx)**: Contains 361,281 lines of guestsâ€™ comments for each Airbnb property. Note that there can be multiple comments per property, not all properties have comments, and comments can be in various languages.

- **Test (test.xlsx)**: Contains 695 lines with the same structure as the train set, but without the `unlisted` column. The actual statuses are withheld and will be used to compare against the predicted statuses (0 or 1).

- **Test Reviews (test_reviews.xlsx)**: Contains 41,866 lines of comments for the properties in the test set, with the same structure as the train reviews set.
